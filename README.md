# LICCB Event Manager Project 2019-2020
This is repository for the LICCB Event Manager.

## Software Choice
One of the main reasons for picking a NodeJS/React stack was because we all have some level of familiarity or experience with this stack.  Several of us have taken web development classes that used NodeJS.  NodeJS also has one of the biggest sets of existing code with the modules provided by npm.  The decision over Flask or Django was mostly due to preference and our group's experience with NodeJS or lack of experience with Flask or Django.

Other more high level web frameworks like Wordpress were not chosen due to their lack of flexibility.  We did not want to end up modifying existing code provided by a plugin inorder to create the user experience we are trying to acheive.  The fact that the previous groups to attempt this project used methods similar to this and did not succeed only bolstered our position.  It also seemed to us that we would get more out of the project by applying our knowledge of web development to code it ourselves as opposed to just putting plugins in Wordpress.  It is also free.

## Theory Of Operation
General idea of how various aspects of the software should work.

### Database:

#### Users:
* Origin of UserID
* Maintains a list of and information regarding login-access users.
* ParticipantID comes from the History table

#### History:
* Origin of ParticipantID
* Maintains a behavior history of participants to favor picking participants that will likely show up and won't cause issues
* Does not persist any personal information other than the participant's name
  * Participant's name should be used to determine if they are already in the history system
* EventCount incremented for every event the person is selected for
* Cancellations incremented everytime the event's Status for the person is 'Cancelled' or 'No Show'
* The Volunteer column will show is if the participant is registered as a Volunteer

#### Events:
* Origin of EventID
* Keeps track of all events
* Stores all global event parameters not stored in the event's table

#### Event#:
* Table created per event
* Follow the naming scheme of 'event' followed by the eventID for the event from the Events table
* The hashtag represents the ID of the specific event the table is created for.

#### Gernal Theory:
All IDs will be UUIDs generated by Node (initial dummy data just uses a number).

When an site user authorized to do so creates an event a row will be added to the 'events' table containing the global parameters for the event. A table for the event will also be created to contain all of the registration information for the people who sign up for the event. This table will also be able to have it's structure dynamically changed on a per event basis to added columns for semi-customizable registration forms.

When a participant registers for an event their first and last names will be cross referenced to the list of past participants in the 'history' table, if a match is found their information will be entered into the event's table with the existing ID found in the 'history' table, otherwise a new row will be created for them in the 'history' table along with a new ID and then their registration information will be entered into the event's table with the newly generated ID.

When the lottery is drawn all of the registrants will have their 'regStatus' set accordingly in the event's table. This process will at some point also incorporate the parameters saved for each participant in the 'history' table for either favoring or disfavoring participants for selection based on their past behavior.
